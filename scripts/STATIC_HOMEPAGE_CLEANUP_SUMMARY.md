# Static Homepage Infrastructure Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed all references to deprecated static homepage infrastructure from CloudToLocalLLM scripts, reflecting the migration to unified Flutter-native architecture in v3.4.0+.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Deployment Scripts

#### `scripts/deploy/deploy-core-only.sh`
- **Removed**: `static-site` container dependency
- **Updated**: Docker compose configuration to only include nginx-proxy and flutter-app
- **Result**: Simplified core deployment without static site container

#### `scripts/deploy/update_and_deploy.sh`
- **Replaced**: `update_static_distribution()` → `update_distribution_files()`
- **Updated**: Distribution logic to create metadata for Flutter homepage instead of static files
- **Removed**: Static homepage file copying logic
- **Added**: Flutter-native download metadata generation

#### `scripts/deploy/deploy-multi-container.sh`
- **Removed**: `static-site` service references from help text and service options
- **Removed**: `build_docs()` function call for static site building
- **Updated**: Examples to focus on Flutter app deployment

### 2. Service Management Scripts

#### `scripts/deploy/update-service.sh`
- **Removed**: `static-site` service from supported services list
- **Removed**: Static site building logic in `build_assets()` function
- **Updated**: Help text and examples to remove static site references

### 3. Distribution and Upload Scripts

#### `scripts/deploy/upload_static_distribution.sh`
- **Updated**: Script header to reflect Flutter-native homepage
- **Changed**: VPS download directory from `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/static_homepage/downloads` to `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/downloads`
- **Maintained**: Core upload functionality for distribution packages

### 4. Verification and Maintenance Scripts

#### `scripts/verification/final_verify.sh`
- **Completely rewritten**: Now verifies Flutter-native architecture instead of static files
- **Removed**: Static file checks (CSS, fonts, CDN references)
- **Added**: Flutter web build verification
- **Added**: Container health checks for unified architecture

#### `scripts/maintenance/fix_index_local_resources.sh`
- **Removed**: Entire script as it was specific to static homepage maintenance

### 5. VPS and Container Scripts

#### `scripts/docker_startup_vps.sh`
- **Updated**: Log messages to reference "Flutter Homepage" instead of generic "Homepage"
- **Clarified**: That both homepage and web app are served by Flutter

#### `scripts/deploy/deploy_to_vps.sh`
- **Updated**: Backup logic to backup Flutter web build instead of static homepage

#### `scripts/deploy/VPS_DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.sh`
- **Replaced**: Static downloads page update with Flutter downloads integration
- **Updated**: Step 8 to reflect Flutter-native download handling

### 6. Documentation Updates

#### `scripts/README.md`
- **Updated**: Application URLs section to clarify Flutter-native architecture
- **Added**: Note explaining unified Flutter architecture eliminates static site containers

#### AUR Info Files
- **Updated**: `static_homepage/cloudtolocalllm-3.5.0-x86_64-aur-info.txt`
- **Updated**: `static_homepage/cloudtolocalllm-3.5.5-x86_64-aur-info.txt`
- **Changed**: "Static Distribution Configuration" → "Flutter-Native Distribution Configuration"
- **Updated**: Deployment workflow descriptions

## Architecture Changes Reflected

### Before (v3.3.x and earlier)
- Separate static-site container for homepage
- Static HTML/CSS files in `static_homepage/` directory
- Nginx routing between static site and Flutter app
- Manual static file management

### After (v3.4.0+)
- Unified Flutter application serves both homepage and app
- Single Flutter web build in `build/web/`
- Simplified container architecture (nginx-proxy + flutter-app only)
- Integrated download management within Flutter

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated dual-container homepage architecture
2. **Simplified Deployment**: Single Flutter build process for all content
3. **Reduced Maintenance**: No separate static file management needed
4. **Improved Consistency**: Unified Material Design 3 across all pages
5. **Better Performance**: Single-page application benefits throughout

## Files Modified
- `scripts/deploy/deploy-core-only.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/update_and_deploy.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/deploy-multi-container.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/update-service.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/upload_static_distribution.sh`
- `scripts/verification/final_verify.sh`
- `scripts/docker_startup_vps.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/deploy_to_vps.sh`
- `scripts/deploy/VPS_DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.sh`
- `scripts/README.md`
- `static_homepage/cloudtolocalllm-3.5.0-x86_64-aur-info.txt`
- `static_homepage/cloudtolocalllm-3.5.5-x86_64-aur-info.txt`

## Files Removed
- `scripts/maintenance/fix_index_local_resources.sh`

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment scripts to ensure Flutter-native architecture works correctly
2. Update any remaining documentation that references static homepage
3. Consider removing `static_homepage/` directory entirely in future versions
4. Verify all container orchestration works with simplified architecture

This cleanup eliminates technical debt and confusion from the deprecated static homepage approach, ensuring all scripts align with the unified Flutter-native architecture.

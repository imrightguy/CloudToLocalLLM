- **VRAM Analysis**: Measures available VRAM for optimal model selection
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests models based on your specific hardware profile

> For detailed information about hardware detection and model recommendations, see [OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md](docs/OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md)

## Data Storage and Privacy

### Local Storage (Default)
- All conversations and data are stored locally by default
- No data is sent to the cloud unless explicitly enabled
- Full control over your data and privacy

### Cloud Storage (Premium)
> **Important Security Warning**: Cloud storage is a premium feature that requires careful consideration:
> - Your data is encrypted but stored on our servers
> - If you lose your access code, we CANNOT recover your data
> - We recommend keeping a secure backup of your access code
> - Cloud storage is subject to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) and [Terms of Service](TERMS.md)

## Window and System Tray Behavior

The application implements a user-friendly window management system:

- **Startup**: The main window is always visible when the application starts
- **System Tray**: A persistent system tray icon provides quick access to:
  - Show/Hide main window
  - Check LLM status
  - Manage tunnel connection
  - Exit application
- **Window Controls**:
  - Close button (X) minimizes to system tray
  - Minimize button minimizes to system tray
  - System tray icon restores the window when clicked

## Premium Features (Currently Free During Testing)

During development, all premium features are available for free to facilitate testing:

- **Cloud LLM Access**: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo) and Anthropic (Claude 3) models
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Sync conversations across devices
- **Remote Access**: Access your local LLM from anywhere
- **Advanced Model Management**: Tools for optimizing model performance

> For more details about premium features, see [PREMIUM_FEATURES.md](docs/PREMIUM_FEATURES.md)

## SSL Configuration

The CloudToLocalLLM VPS deployment, specifically the `webapp` service, handles SSL termination. Here's an overview of the SSL strategy (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD` for full details):

1.  **Self-Signed Certificates (Initial Default for `webapp` container)**:
    *   For ease of initial setup, the `webapp` Docker image is configured to generate and use self-signed SSL certificates by default.
    *   This allows the service to start up with HTTPS immediately without external dependencies.
    *   Browsers will show a warning for self-signed certificates; this is expected for local development or if you haven't configured a public certificate yet.

2.  **Let's Encrypt (Recommended for Public Servers)**:
    *   Free, automated certificates from Let's Encrypt.
    *   Requires your domain to be correctly pointed to your VPS.
    *   The `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD` guide explains how to configure the system to use Let's Encrypt, typically involving the `certbot-service`.

3.  **Commercial/Wildcard SSL Certificates**: 
    *   Suitable for production environments, especially with multiple subdomains.
    *   Covers all subdomains (e.g., `*.cloudtolocalllm.online`).
    *   Requires purchasing a certificate and configuring Nginx to use it (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD`).

See [DEPLOYMENT.MD](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed SSL configuration instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

## Static Portal Files (REVIEW: Is this still the process, or are all static assets part of the Flutter web build in the webapp container?)

To update the static portal files (e.g., `index.html`, `login.html`, `theme.css`):

1.  **Upload changed files to the VPS:**
    Replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the path to your SSH key if different.
    ```bash
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa index.html root@cloudtolocalllm.online:/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/index.html
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa login.html root@cloudtolocalllm.online:/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/login.html
    scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa css/theme.css root@cloudtolocalllm.online:/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/css/theme.css
    ```

    > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT copy files directly into the container.**
    > Any files placed in `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside the container will be overwritten by the contents of `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/` on the host.

    No container restart is needed for static file changes.

## Deployment (REVIEW: Consolidate with /docs/DEPLOYMENT.md and ensure VPS script `scripts/setup/docker_startup_vps.sh` is the primary documented method for VPS)

### Dart Deployment Tool (REVIEW: Is this tool (`tools/deploy.dart`) still maintained/used or replaced by `admin_control_daemon` + `docker_startup_vps.sh`?)

We provide a unified Dart-based tool for deploying and managing the CloudToLocalLLM portal:

```bash
# Install dependencies
dart pub add args path

# Deploy with default configuration
dart tools/deploy.dart deploy
# ... (other commands from original README) ...
dart tools/deploy.dart --help
```

Using this tool eliminates the need for multiple shell scripts and provides a consistent deployment process.

## System Daemon Management (REVIEW: Ensure this aligns with `admin_control_daemon` and `docker_startup_vps.sh`. Is `cloudctl` still a thing?)

After deployment, you can manage the system using the `cloudctl` command:

```
cloudctl {start|stop|restart|status|logs|update}
```

### Available Commands
- `cloudctl start`: Start all services
- `cloudctl stop`: Stop all services
- `cloudctl restart`: Restart all services
- `cloudctl status`: Check service status
- `cloudctl logs [service]`: View logs (available services: auth, web, admin, db)
- `cloudctl update`: Pull latest changes and restart services

### Service Configuration
The system uses systemd for service management. The service files are located at:
- `/etc/systemd/system/cloudtolocalllm.service`: Main service (REVIEW: How does this relate to the Dockerized setup managed by `admin_control_daemon`?)
- `/etc/systemd/system/cloudtolocalllm-monitor.service`: Monitoring service (if enabled)

## Updating Live Site Files (Nginx Container) (REVIEW: This seems to refer to a generic nginx setup. For this project, the `webapp` container serves the Flutter web build. Is this section still relevant, or does it describe an old process?)

All live HTML, CSS, and static files for your site are served from:

```
/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/
```
**on the host**. This directory is bind-mounted into the running `nginx-proxy` container at `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

**To update your site:**
1. Edit your HTML or CSS files locally.
2. Upload them to `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/` on your VPS.
   Example using `scp`:
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/your_ssh_key localfile.html user@your_vps_ip:/opt/cloudtolocalllm/portal/localfile.html
   ```
   (Replace `~/.ssh/your_ssh_key`, `localfile.html`, `user@your_vps_ip` accordingly)
3. Nginx will automatically serve the updated files. No container restart is needed.

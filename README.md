##üì¶ Building Client Applications

Instructions for building and packaging client applications for different platforms:

### Windows

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Flutter SDK installed and configured.
    *   Inno Setup 6 installed (e.g., from [https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)), and `ISCC.exe` should be in your system PATH or one of the common installation locations checked by the script.
    *   A `LICENSE` file in the project root.
2.  **Build Process**:
    *   Run the `scripts/improve_windows_app.ps1` PowerShell script.
    *   This script will:
        *   Read the application version from `pubspec.yaml`.
        *   Build the Flutter Windows application (`flutter build windows`).
        *   Generate an Inno Setup script (`.iss`) file.
        *   Compile the installer using `ISCC.exe`.
        *   The resulting installer will be placed in the `installer/` directory.
3.  **Code Signing (Manual Step)**: For a trusted installation, the generated executable and installer should be signed with a valid code signing certificate. This step is typically performed manually after the build.

### Linux (AUR Package)

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Flutter SDK installed and configured.
    *   Arch Linux environment with `base-devel` package group installed (for `makepkg`).
    *   A `LICENSE` file in the project root.
2.  **Build Flutter App**:
    *   Generate a release build of the Flutter Linux application:
        ```bash
        flutter build linux --release
        ```
    *   This will create the application bundle in `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/`.
3.  **Create Release Artifact**:
    *   Archive the contents of the `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/` directory into a `.tar.gz` file. The `PKGBUILD.template` expects this tarball to contain the `bundle/` directory at its root, or a single top-level directory which then contains `bundle/`. Name it appropriately, e.g., `cloudtolocalllm-linux-x64-1.3.3.tar.gz` (replace `1.3.3` with the actual version).
    *   Include the `LICENSE` file in the root of this tarball.
4.  **Host the Artifact**:
    *   Upload the created `.tar.gz` file to a publicly accessible URL (e.g., as a release asset on GitHub).
5.  **Prepare `PKGBUILD`**:
    *   Copy `PKGBUILD.template` to a new file named `PKGBUILD`.
    *   Edit `PKGBUILD`:
        *   Update the `pkgver` if the script didn't pick it up correctly (it tries to get it from `pubspec.yaml`).
        *   Replace the placeholder `source` URL with the direct download link to your hosted `.tar.gz` artifact.
        *   Calculate the `sha256sum` of your `.tar.gz` artifact (`sha256sum your-artifact.tar.gz`) and replace `'SKIP'` in the `sha256sums` array with this sum.
        *   Review and update `maintainer` and `contributor` fields.
        *   Ensure the `license` field accurately reflects your project's license. If you have a `LICENSE` file, `custom:LICENSE` is appropriate, assuming the `LICENSE` file is included in the tarball and installed by the `PKGBUILD`.
6.  **Test Locally**:
    *   In the directory containing your `PKGBUILD` file (and nothing else related to the build, to ensure a clean build):
        ```bash
        makepkg -si
        ```
    *   This will download the source, verify checksums, build the package, and install it. Test the installed application.
7.  **AUR Submission**:
    *   Once the package builds and installs correctly, you can follow the instructions on the Arch Wiki to submit it to the Arch User Repository (AUR). This involves creating an AUR account, creating a new Git repository on `aur.archlinux.org`, and pushing your `PKGBUILD` (and any other necessary files like a `.SRCINFO` file generated by `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`).

## Security: Running Containers as Non-Root

All custom containers (webapp, admin-daemon, cloud, netdata, etc.) are configured to run as a non-root user by default using `user: "1000:1000"` in their respective docker-compose files. This improves security and compatibility.

- If your main non-root user has a different UID/GID, update the `user:` field accordingly.
- Official third-party images (like postgres, fusionauth) are not overridden.
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure the mapped volumes are owned by the correct UID/GID on the host.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- **Docker Container Issues:**
  - **Container not starting/restarting:**
    - Check logs: `sudo docker logs <container_name_or_id>` (e.g., `sudo docker logs cloudtolocalllm-webapp-1`)
    - Check status: `sudo docker ps -a` (look for `Exited` or `Restarting` status)
  - **Permission errors for volume mounts:** Ensure the host directories mapped into containers (especially `./certbot/conf` for SSL certificates) have the correct ownership and permissions for the user the container runs as (often UID/GID 1000 if not specified otherwise, or the `cloudllm` user for this project).
  - **`docker-compose` vs `docker compose`:** Be consistent. The newer `docker compose` (v2 plugin) is recommended. If you encounter `docker-compose: command not found`, try `docker compose`.
- **SSL Certificate Problems (Nginx/Webapp):**
  - **"No such file or directory" for `fullchain.pem` or `privkey.pem` in Nginx logs:**
    - Verify the volume mount in `docker-compose.yml`: `webapp` service should mount `./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt`.
    - Check host path: `ls -l /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/conf/live/cloudtolocalllm.online/` (or the path you configured Certbot to use). Ensure `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` exist and are valid symlinks to files in the `../../archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/` directory.
    - If `.../live/cloudtolocalllm.online` contains actual files instead of symlinks, or if it's an `...online-0001` directory, you might need to rename/remove the incorrect `live` directory and re-run Certbot, or manually fix the symlinks (e.g., `ln -sfn ../../archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/privkey1.pem privkey.pem`).
    - Ensure correct permissions for `privkey.pem` (e.g., `640` or `644`, readable by the Nginx user inside the container).
  - **Browser SSL warnings (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID):** If using Let's Encrypt staging certificates, this is expected. Switch to production certificates for public use.
- **Git Issues on VPS:**
  - **"dubious ownership":** Run `git config --global --add safe.directory /opt/cloudtolocalllm` as the `cloudllm` user.
  - **"cannot open '.git/FETCH_HEAD': Permission denied":** Ensure `/opt/cloudtolocalllm` and its contents are owned by the `cloudllm` user: `sudo chown -R cloudllm:cloudllm /opt/cloudtolocalllm`.
- **Flutter Web App UI Not Updating:**
  - After `git pull` on the server, you must rebuild the `webapp` Docker image: `docker compose build --no-cache webapp` (as `cloudllm`).
  - Then, recreate the container: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate webapp` (as `cloudllm`).
- **General VPS Issues:**
  - Refer to `scripts/troubleshooting_commands.sh` for a list of helpful diagnostic commands.
  - Check system logs: `journalctl -u cloudtolocalllm.service` (if using the systemd service), `dmesg`, `/var/log/syslog`.

# CloudToLocalLLM: Your Personal AI Powerhouse üå©Ô∏èüíª

Run powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) directly on your machine and seamlessly sync your conversations to the cloud. Experience the best of local control and cloud convenience.

## ‚ú® Features

- Run LLMs locally using Ollama or LM Studio
- Hardware detection for optimal model recommendations
- Support for latest models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Phi-3, Mistral, etc.)
- Optional cloud synchronization of conversations (premium feature)
- Remote access to your local LLM
- Modern, responsive UI
- Cross-platform support

## Hardware Detection & Model Recommendations

CloudToLocalLLM automatically detects your hardware capabilities and recommends appropriate models:

- **System RAM Detection**: Identifies available system memory
- **GPU Detection**: Detects NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPUs when available
- **VRAM Analysis**: Measures available VRAM for optimal model selection
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests models based on your specific hardware profile

> For detailed information about hardware detection and model recommendations, see [OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md](docs/OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md)

## Data Storage and Privacy

### Local Storage (Default)
- All conversations and data are stored locally by default
- No data is sent to the cloud unless explicitly enabled
- Full control over your data and privacy

### Cloud Storage (Premium)
> **Important Security Warning**: Cloud storage is a premium feature that requires careful consideration:
> - Your data is encrypted but stored on our servers
> - If you lose your access code, we CANNOT recover your data
> - We recommend keeping a secure backup of your access code
> - Cloud storage is subject to our [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY.md) and [Terms of Service](docs/TERMS.md)

## Window and System Tray Behavior

The application implements a user-friendly window management system:

- **Startup**: The main window is always visible when the application starts
- **System Tray**: A persistent system tray icon provides quick access to:
  - Show/Hide main window
  - Check LLM status
  - Manage tunnel connection
  - Exit application
- **Window Controls**:
  - Close button (X) minimizes to system tray
  - Minimize button minimizes to system tray
  - System tray icon restores the window when clicked

## Planned Premium Features

The following premium features are planned for future releases. Some aspects may be available during development for testing purposes:

- **Cloud LLM Access**: Access to leading models like OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo) and Anthropic (Claude 3). *(Planned)*
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Sync conversations across devices. *(Partially available for testing)*
- **Remote Access**: Access your local LLM from anywhere. *(Partially available for testing)*
- **Advanced Model Management**: Tools for optimizing model performance. *(Partially available for testing)*

> For more details about upcoming premium features and their development status, see [PREMIUM_FEATURES.md](docs/PREMIUM_FEATURES.md)

4. **Model Information**: View model details, including size and capabilities

### Cloud Synchronization (Premium)

> **Note**: Cloud synchronization is a premium feature (free during testing) that requires:
> - A valid subscription (waived during testing)
> - Explicit opt-in
> - Secure access code setup
> - Understanding of data security implications

1. Create an account or log in
2. Enable cloud synchronization in Settings
3. Set up your secure access code

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- `lib/`: Main Flutter application code (client-side UI and logic).
- `admin_control_daemon/`: Dart-based daemon for managing the application stack on a server.
  - `bin/server.dart`: Entrypoint for the admin daemon.
- `admin-ui/`: Vue.js based admin interface for interacting with the `admin_control_daemon`. (REVIEW: Is this still actively used and maintained, or has it been superseded by direct API calls or other UIs?)
- `assets/`: Global assets for the Flutter application (e.g., images, icons).
- `config/`: Configuration files for various parts of the stack.
  - `docker/`: Contains Dockerfiles (e.g., `Dockerfile.admin_daemon`, `Dockerfile.web`) and Docker Compose files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.admin.yml`) for defining and orchestrating services.
  - `nginx/`: Nginx configuration templates (e.g., `nginx.conf`) used by the `webapp` service.
  - `systemd/`: Example systemd service files. (REVIEW: Are these still relevant with the Docker-centric deployment via `admin_control_daemon`?)
- `scripts/`: Shell scripts for various tasks.
  - `setup/`: Scripts like `docker_startup_vps.sh` for initializing the VPS environment.
  - `release/`, `build/`, `deploy/`: Other utility scripts. (REVIEW: Consolidate or document purpose clearly).
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation for different aspects of the project.
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/`: Platform-specific code and build configurations for the Flutter application.
- `tunnel_service/`: (Appears to be a separate Dart project for ngrok-like tunneling. REVIEW: Document its role and integration, or remove if deprecated). Found in `backend/tunnel_service/`.
- `auth_service/`: (Appears to be a separate Dart project. REVIEW: Document its role, likely related to FusionAuth, or remove if deprecated).
- `backend/`: Contains backend services like `tunnel_service`.

## Security: Running Containers as Non-Root

All custom containers (webapp, admin-daemon, cloud, netdata, etc.) are configured to run as a non-root user by default using `user: "1000:1000"` in their respective docker-compose files. This improves security and compatibility.

- If your main non-root user has a different UID/GID, update the `user:` field accordingly.
- Official third-party images (like postgres, fusionauth) are not overridden.
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure the mapped volumes are owned by the correct UID/GID on the host.

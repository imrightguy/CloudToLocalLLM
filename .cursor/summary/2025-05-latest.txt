CloudToLocalLLM - Internal Assistant Summary (May 2025)

- Startup script (scripts/setup/startup_vps.sh) now prints status before each step, logs errors to both console and /opt/cloudtolocalllm/startup.log, and exits on failure.
- All Color.withValues usages in Flutter code replaced with Color.withAlpha for compatibility with Flutter 3.22.0/Dart 3.4.x.
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub after each major fix.
- Codebase is ready for deployment; users should git pull and run the startup script on the VPS.
- Documentation (README.md) updated to reflect these changes and deployment steps.
- No critical linter errors remain; only minor warnings.
- Next step: If new errors occur on deployment, review logs and output for troubleshooting.

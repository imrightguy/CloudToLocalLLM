# SSL Certificate Setup

This document describes the SSL certificate setup process for CloudToLocalLLM.

## Overview

The application uses Let's Encrypt certificates managed by Certbot for SSL/TLS encryption. The certificates are automatically renewed every 12 hours if they're close to expiration.

## Certificate Management

### Initial Setup

1. The certificates are managed by the `certbot` container which runs as root
2. After certificate creation or renewal, ownership is changed to the nginx user (101:101) to ensure proper access
3. The certificates are stored in the following locations:
   - Live certificates: `./certbot/live/`
   - Archived certificates: `./certbot/archive/`

### Important Notes

- The nginx container runs as user 101:101 (nginx user)
- Certificates must be owned by the nginx user for proper access
- Ownership is automatically changed after certificate creation and renewal
- The certbot container handles all certificate operations and permission management

### Backup

A backup script is provided to backup certificates before any changes:

```bash
./backup_ssl.sh
```

This will create a timestamped backup in `./certbot/backup/`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues:

1. Check certificate ownership:
   ```bash
   ls -la ./certbot/live/
   ls -la ./certbot/archive/
   ```

2. Certificates should be owned by user 101:101 (nginx user)

3. If permissions are incorrect, you can fix them by:
   ```bash
   chown -R 101:101 ./certbot/live ./certbot/archive
   ```

4. After fixing permissions, reload nginx:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp nginx -s reload
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Nginx Not Listening on Port 443

If nginx is not listening on port 443, check the following:

1. Verify the SSL server block is not commented out in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`
2. Check nginx error logs:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp cat /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```
3. Common syntax errors to look for:
   - Uncommented comment lines (should start with `#`)
   - Missing closing braces
   - Incorrect indentation

### 2. Certificate Permission Issues

If nginx can't read the certificates:

1. Check certificate ownership:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/cloudtolocalllm.online/
   ```

2. Fix ownership from within the certbot container:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-certbot chown -R 101:101 /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
   ```

### 3. Volume Mount Issues

If certificates aren't visible in the nginx container:

1. Check docker-compose.yml volume mounts:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
     - ./certbot/live:/etc/letsencrypt/live
     - ./certbot/archive:/etc/letsencrypt/archive
   ```

2. Ensure these mounts are not commented out

### 4. 404 Not Found

If you get a 404 error after SSL is working:

1. Check that the root directory is correctly set in the nginx config
2. Verify that the files exist in the mounted volume
3. Check nginx access logs:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp cat /var/log/nginx/access.log
   ```

## Flutter Web Deployment (Best Practice)

- The Flutter web build output (`build/web`) is now mounted directly into the Nginx container using a volume in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./build/web:/usr/share/nginx/html
  ```
- To deploy a new version of the app:
  1. Run `flutter build web` locally or on the VPS.
  2. The changes are instantly reflected in the running containerâ€”no need to copy files manually.
  3. If you update the container image or config, just run `docker compose up -d webapp` to restart the container.
- The deploy script no longer copies the build output; it just builds and restarts as needed.

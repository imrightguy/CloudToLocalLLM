# SSL Certificate Setup

This document describes the SSL certificate setup process for CloudToLocalLLM, primarily managed via Certbot within a Docker container.

## Overview

The application uses Let's Encrypt certificates managed by the `certbot` Docker container for SSL/TLS encryption. These certificates are configured for automatic renewal. The Nginx service, running in the `webapp` container, uses these certificates to serve HTTPS traffic.

## Certificate Management

### Initial Setup & Renewal

1. The `certbot` container handles certificate acquisition (for domains like `cloudtolocalllm.online`, `app.cloudtolocalllm.online`, etc.) and automated renewals.
2. After certificate creation or renewal, the `certbot` container (or an associated script like `certbot_permissions_hook.sh`) is responsible for setting correct file permissions.
   - Nginx (typically running as user `101:101` in its container) needs to read these certificates.
   - Permissions are usually set so that the certificate files (`.pem`) are readable by this user (e.g., owned by `101:101` or having world-readable permissions like `644`). Symlinks and directories also need appropriate permissions.
3. Certificates are stored on the host in volumes mounted into the containers:
   - Live certificates (symlinks): `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/live/`
   - Archived certificates (actual files): `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/`
   - Inside containers, these often map to `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` and `/etc/letsencrypt/archive/`.

### Important Notes

- The nginx container runs as user 101:101 (nginx user)
- Certificates must be owned by the nginx user for proper access
- Ownership is automatically changed after certificate creation and renewal
- The certbot container handles all certificate operations and permission management

### Backup

A backup script is provided to backup certificates before any changes:

```bash
./backup_ssl.sh
```

This will create a timestamped backup in `./certbot/backup/`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues:

1. Check certificate ownership:
   ```bash
   ls -la ./certbot/live/
   ls -la ./certbot/archive/
   ```

2. Certificates should be owned by user 101:101 (nginx user)

3. If permissions are incorrect, you can fix them by:
   ```bash
   chown -R 101:101 ./certbot/live ./certbot/archive
   ```

4. After fixing permissions, reload nginx:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp nginx -s reload
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Nginx Not Listening on Port 443 or SSL Errors

If Nginx isn't serving HTTPS correctly, or you see SSL-related errors in `docker compose logs webapp`:

1. Verify the Nginx configuration:
   - The main SSL configuration is in `config/nginx/nginx-webapp-internal.conf` (mounted to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` in the `webapp` container).
   - Ensure server blocks for HTTPS listen on `443 ssl http2;` (or `443 ssl;`).
   - Check that `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` point to the correct paths:
     ```nginx
     ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/cloudtolocalllm.online/fullchain.pem;
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/cloudtolocalllm.online/privkey.pem;
     ```
2. Test Nginx configuration syntax from inside the container:
   ```bash
   docker exec cloudtolocalllm-webapp nginx -t
   ```
3. Check Nginx error logs within the container or via `docker compose logs webapp`.

### 2. Certificate Permission Issues

If nginx can't read the certificates:

1. Check certificate ownership:
   ```bash
   # From the VPS host
   ls -la /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/live/cloudtolocalllm.online/
   ls -la /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/
   ```
   The owner should effectively be the Nginx user (e.g., 101).

2. Fix ownership/permissions:
   - **Preferred**: Let Certbot handle it. Restarting the `certbot` container or triggering its permission hook script (if one exists, like `certbot_permissions_hook.sh` referenced in `docker-compose.yml`) might resolve this.
   - **Manual (Host, as root)**:
     ```bash
     sudo chown -R 101:101 /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/live /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive
     sudo chmod -R o-rwx /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive # Secure private keys
     sudo chmod -R ug+rX,o+rX /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/live # Ensure nginx can read/traverse
     sudo chmod 644 /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/*.pem
     sudo chmod 600 /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/privkey*.pem 
     # Ensure the group 101 can read privkey if nginx runs as nginx:nginx (101:101)
     # sudo chgrp 101 /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/privkey*.pem
     # sudo chmod 640 /opt/cloudtolocalllm/certbot/archive/cloudtolocalllm.online/privkey*.pem

     # After changes, restart webapp
     docker compose restart webapp
     ```
   - **Manual (Certbot container exec)**:
     ```bash
     docker exec cloudtolocalllm-certbot chown -R 101:101 /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
     # Add chmod commands as above, targeting /etc/letsencrypt paths
     ```
     Then restart `webapp`.

### 3. Volume Mount Issues

If certificates aren't visible in the nginx container:

1. Check docker-compose.yml volume mounts:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
     - ./certbot/live:/etc/letsencrypt/live
     - ./certbot/archive:/etc/letsencrypt/archive
   ```

2. Ensure these mounts are not commented out

### 4. `static_homepage` Not Found (403/404 on main domain)

If you get a 403 or 404 error for `https://cloudtolocalllm.online` after SSL is working:

1. Ensure the `static_homepage` directory exists at `/opt/cloudtolocalllm/static_homepage`.
2. Ensure it contains an `index.html` file.
3. The Nginx configuration (`config/nginx/nginx-webapp-internal.conf`) should have a server block for `cloudtolocalllm.online` that sets `root /usr/share/nginx/landing;` (or similar, matching the volume mount for `static_homepage`).
   The `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./static_homepage:/usr/share/nginx/landing`.
4. If the directory was deleted, restore it from git history (see `VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` troubleshooting).

## Flutter Web Deployment (Best Practice)

- The Flutter web build output (`build/web`) is now mounted directly into the Nginx container using a volume in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./build/web:/usr/share/nginx/html
  ```
- To deploy a new version of the app:
  1. Run `flutter build web` locally or on the VPS.
  2. The changes are instantly reflected in the running containerâ€”no need to copy files manually.
  3. If you update the container image or config, just run `docker compose up -d webapp` to restart the container.
- The deploy script no longer copies the build output; it just builds and restarts as needed.

# Obsolete Deployment Documentation Archive

This directory contains deployment documentation that has been superseded by the unified deployment workflow.

## Replacement Document

All deployment procedures are now consolidated in:
**`docs/COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md`**

## Archived Documents

These documents are kept for historical reference but should NOT be used:

- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Generic, outdated deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_ENHANCED.md` - Too complex, outdated checklist
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Incomplete deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Partial deployment information
- `VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - VPS-only deployment guide (incomplete)
- `VPS_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Outdated VPS instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT_RESULTS.md` - Historical deployment results
- `RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Outdated release process
- `RELEASE_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Superseded update instructions

## Migration

`docs/COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_WORKFLOW.md`

This unified document provides:

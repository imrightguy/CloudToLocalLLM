## 📝 **Contribution Workflow**

### **1. Before You Start**

- 📖 **Universal Documentation-First Methodology**: **ALL** contributions MUST begin with a review of relevant project documentation and `.kiro/steering/` files. Understand the specific git workflows, CI/CD guidelines, and architectural structures defined for the project.
- 🔍 **Check Existing Issues**: Avoid duplicate work.
- 💬 **Discuss Major Changes**: Use GitHub Discussions.
- 🎯 **Follow Roadmap**: Align with project priorities.

### **2. Development Process**

- 🧠 **Structured Reasoning**: For complex changes, contributors are encouraged (and Kilocode is mandated) to use a systematic reasoning framework (like Sequential Thinking) to break down problems and verify solutions.

#### **Create a Branch**

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or bug fix branch
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

#### **Make Changes**

- Follow [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Test on target platforms

#### **Commit Guidelines**

```bash
# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add system tray connection status indicator"
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in chat service"
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide for v3.4.0"

# Commit types:
# feat: new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation
# style: formatting
# refactor: code restructuring
# test: adding tests
# chore: maintenance
```

### **3. Pull Request Process**

#### **Before Submitting**

- ✅ All tests pass (`flutter test`)
- ✅ Code follows style guidelines (`flutter analyze`)
- ✅ Documentation is updated

#### **Create Pull Request**

1. **Push Branch**: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
2. **Open PR**: Use the provided PR template
3. **Describe Changes**: Explain what and why
4. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues with `Fixes #123`
5. **Request Review**: Tag relevant maintainers

#### **PR Requirements**

## 🎨 **Coding Standards**

### **Flutter/Dart Guidelines**

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- Use `flutter_lints` package rules (already configured)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions

### **Code Organization**

```dart
// File structure
/// Brief description of the file's purpose
/// 
/// Longer description if needed with usage examples.

// Imports (grouped and sorted)
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

import '../models/chat_message.dart';
import '../services/streaming_chat_service.dart';

// Class definition
/// Widget for displaying chat messages with proper formatting
class ChatMessageWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  // Implementation
}
```

### **Documentation Standards**

```dart
/// Service for managing native system tray functionality.
/// 
/// Provides cross-platform system tray integration using the tray_manager
/// package with real-time connection status updates.
/// 
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final trayService = NativeTrayService();
/// await trayService.initialize(
///   tunnelManager: tunnelManager,
///   onShowWindow: () => showMainWindow(),
/// );
/// ```
class NativeTrayService {
  /// Initialize the native tray service with required callbacks.
  /// 
  /// Returns `true` if initialization was successful, `false` otherwise.
  Future<bool> initialize({
    required TunnelManagerService tunnelManager,
    VoidCallback? onShowWindow,
  }) async {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing Guidelines**

### **Test Types**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows

### **Writing Tests**

```dart
// Unit test example
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:CloudToLocalLLM/services/streaming_chat_service.dart';
import 'package:CloudToLocalLLM/services/connection_manager_service.dart';

void main() {
  group('StreamingChatService', () {
    late StreamingChatService chatService;
    late MockConnectionManagerService mockConnectionManager;

    setUp(() {
      mockConnectionManager = MockConnectionManagerService();
      chatService = StreamingChatService(mockConnectionManager);
    });

    test('should create new conversation', () {
      chatService.createConversation();
      expect(chatService.conversations.length, greaterThan(1)); // Welcome + new
      expect(chatService.currentConversation, isNotNull);
    });
  });
}
```

### **Running Tests**

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/chat_service_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

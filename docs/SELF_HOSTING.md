# Self-Hosting CloudToLocalLLM

This document provides instructions and considerations for self-hosting the CloudToLocalLLM application stack.

## SSL Configuration

The CloudToLocalLLM VPS deployment, specifically the `webapp` service, handles SSL termination. Here's an overview of the SSL strategy (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD` for full details):

1.  **Self-Signed Certificates (Initial Default for `webapp` container)**:
    *   For ease of initial setup, the `webapp` Docker image is configured to generate and use self-signed SSL certificates by default.
    *   This allows the service to start up with HTTPS immediately without external dependencies.
    *   Browsers will show a warning for self-signed certificates; this is expected for local development or if you haven't configured a public certificate yet.

2.  **Let's Encrypt (Recommended for Public Servers)**:
    *   Free, automated certificates from Let's Encrypt.
    *   Requires your domain to be correctly pointed to your VPS.
    *   The `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD` guide explains how to configure the system to use Let's Encrypt, typically involving the `certbot-service`.

3.  **Commercial/Wildcard SSL Certificates**:
    *   Suitable for production environments, especially with multiple subdomains.
    *   Covers all subdomains (e.g., `*.cloudtolocalllm.online`).
    *   Requires purchasing a certificate and configuring Nginx to use it (see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.MD`).

See [DEPLOYMENT.MD](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed SSL configuration instructions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher recommended)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or higher recommended)
- (Optional) Ollama or LM Studio installed locally. Ollama can be installed via its desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux) or run via Docker. For server/VPS deployments, ensure Ollama is not directly exposed to the internet without proper security measures.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thrightguy/CloudToLocalLLM.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CloudToLocalLLM
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the application (for local development/testing):
   ```
   flutter run
   ```
   For server deployment, refer to the Docker-based setup in other sections of this guide (e.g., using `scripts/setup/docker_startup_vps.sh`).

## Static Portal Files

(REVIEW: Is this still the process, or are all static assets part of the Flutter web build in the webapp container?)

Previously, static files like `index.html` for the main portal were managed separately. With the current Flutter web setup, these are handled as follows:

1.  **`web/index.html`**: This file in the project root acts as the main HTML template for the Flutter web application.
2.  **`flutter build web`**: This command compiles the Dart code and assets (from `lib/` and `assets/`) into the `build/web` directory.
3.  **Docker Build (`webapp` service)**: The `Dockerfile.web` copies the contents of `build/web` into the Nginx server root within the `webapp` container (typically `/usr/share/nginx/html`).

Therefore, to update any aspect of the main web application's UI or static assets, changes should be made within the Flutter project (`lib/`, `assets/`, `web/index.html`), and then the application needs to be rebuilt and redeployed via Docker:

```bash
# 1. Make changes in your local Flutter project
# 2. Commit and push your changes

# 3. On the server:
cd /opt/cloudtolocalllm
git pull
docker compose build --no-cache webapp
docker compose up -d webapp
```

No manual `scp` of individual HTML/CSS files to a separate portal directory on the host is required for the main application.

## Advanced Deployment Topics

### Dart Deployment Tool (REVIEW: Is this tool (`tools/deploy.dart`) still maintained/used or replaced by `admin_control_daemon` + `docker_startup_vps.sh`?)

(This section describes a potentially deprecated Dart-based deployment tool. Modern deployments likely use `admin_control_daemon` and `scripts/setup/docker_startup_vps.sh` as detailed in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/VPS_DEPLOYMENT.md`.)

We provide a unified Dart-based tool for deploying and managing the CloudToLocalLLM portal:

```bash
# Install dependencies
dart pub add args path

# Deploy with default configuration
dart tools/deploy.dart deploy
# ... (other commands from original README) ...
dart tools/deploy.dart --help
```

Using this tool eliminates the need for multiple shell scripts and provides a consistent deployment process.

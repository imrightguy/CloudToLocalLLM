## Compatibility Strategy

### Parallel Operation Period
During the migration, both systems will operate in parallel:

**Week 1-6: Development and Testing**
- Ansible automation developed alongside existing scripts
- No changes to production workflows
- Testing performed in isolated environments
- Existing scripts remain primary deployment method

**Week 7-8: Gradual Migration**
- Ansible becomes primary for new deployments
- Existing scripts available as fallback
- Production workflows gradually migrated
- Both systems maintained during transition

**Week 9+: Ansible Primary**
- Ansible becomes sole deployment method
- Legacy scripts deprecated but preserved
- Emergency fallback procedures documented
- Legacy scripts archived for reference

### Fallback Procedures

**Immediate Fallback (During Migration)**
```bash
# If Ansible deployment fails, use legacy scripts
echo "Ansible deployment failed, falling back to legacy scripts"
./scripts/powershell/version_manager.ps1 increment minor
./scripts/powershell/Build-GitHubReleaseAssets-Simple.ps1
./scripts/deploy/update_and_deploy.sh
```

**Emergency Rollback (Post-Migration)**
```bash
# Emergency restoration of legacy scripts
git checkout legacy-scripts-backup
chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh
./scripts/emergency-deployment.sh
```

### Compatibility Bridges

**Script Wrappers**
Create wrapper scripts that call Ansible playbooks:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Legacy script compatibility wrapper
echo "This script now uses Ansible automation"
ansible-playbook site.yml -e increment="$1"
```

**Environment Variables**
Maintain compatibility with existing environment variables:
```yaml
# Ansible playbook respects legacy environment variables
- name: Use legacy environment if available
  set_fact:
    build_type: "{{ ansible_env.BUILD_TYPE | default('release') }}"
```

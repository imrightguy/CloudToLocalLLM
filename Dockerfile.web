# Set WORKDIR first, then switch user.

USER flutter

# Configure git safe directory.
# This will write to /home/flutter/.gitconfig
RUN git config --global --add safe.directory /sdks/flutter

# Copy application source
COPY . .
# Ensure flutter user owns these files after copy. sudo should be available.
RUN sudo chown -R flutter:flutter /home/flutter/project

RUN flutter build web --release

# Stage 2: Serve the Flutter web application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy custom Nginx configuration

# Copy the Flutter web build from the builder stage

# Stage 1: Build the Flutter web application
FROM cirrusci/flutter:stable as builder

# The cirrusci/flutter image has a 'flutter' user (uid/gid 1000).
# We'll use that user. Switch to it if not default.
# The WORKDIR is often already /home/flutter/project or similar, but we'll set it.
USER flutter
WORKDIR /home/flutter/project

# Configure git safe directory for the flutter user
RUN git config --global --add safe.directory /sdks/flutter

# Copy application source (ensure flutter user owns these files)
# We COPY to the WORKDIR, then chown to ensure flutter user owns them
COPY . .
RUN sudo chown -R flutter:flutter /home/flutter/project

# Build the Flutter web application
RUN flutter build web --release

# Stage 2: Serve the Flutter web application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy custom Nginx configuration
COPY config/nginx/nginx-webapp-internal.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy the Flutter web build from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /home/flutter/project/build/web /usr/share/nginx/html

# Nginx user setup (nginx:alpine usually has an 'nginx' user)
# Ensure nginx user owns the web files and Nginx-related directories
RUN \
    chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html && \
    chown -R nginx:nginx /var/cache/nginx && \
    chown -R nginx:nginx /var/log/nginx && \
    chown -R nginx:nginx /etc/nginx/conf.d && \
    touch /var/run/nginx.pid && \
    chown -R nginx:nginx /var/run/nginx.pid

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 80 443

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

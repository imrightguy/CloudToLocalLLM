## üö® **REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **High Priority (Phase 2)**
- ‚ùå **Missing user documentation files** - Installation and setup guides still missing
- ‚ùå **Broken README links** - Several documentation links still point to missing files
- ‚ùå **TODO items in README** - 20+ TODO items still need resolution

### **Medium Priority (Phase 3)**
- ‚ùå **Deprecated build scripts** - Python build scripts still present
- ‚ùå **Script documentation** - scripts/README.md needs review and updates

---

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS (Phase 2)**

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Create missing user documentation**:
   - `docs/USER_DOCUMENTATION/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
   - `docs/USER_DOCUMENTATION/FIRST_TIME_SETUP.md`

2. **Create development documentation**:
   - `docs/DEVELOPMENT/DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md`
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` in project root

3. **Fix remaining README.md issues**:
   - Resolve remaining TODO items
   - Fix broken documentation links
   - Add missing badges and screenshots

### **Success Criteria for Phase 2**
- [ ] All referenced documentation files exist
- [ ] All README.md links functional
- [ ] User installation process clearly documented
- [ ] Developer contribution process documented
